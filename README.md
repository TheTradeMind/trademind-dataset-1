# Trademind LLM Training Datasets

Welcome to the Trademind LLM Training Datasets repository!

This repository contains the curated collection of datasets that were used to train the Trademind AI, the core intelligence behind the Trademind network project. These datasets encompass historical trade data, tokenomics metadata, market news sentiment, and engineered features, providing the foundation upon which Trademind AI's financial analysis capabilities were built.

## 📈 Project Overview

The Trademind network leverages the advanced capabilities of the Trademind AI, a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM), to derive real-time insights, forecast market movements, and enhance financial decision-making within the network.

The multi-modal datasets within this repository were instrumental in training Trademind AI, enabling it to:

- Understand complex financial data patterns.
- Extract meaningful sentiment from market news.
- Generate predictive features from diverse data sources.
- Power the analytical and forecasting functions of the Trademind network.

## 🧠 Datasets Used for Training Trademind AI

-   `trades.csv`: Historical trading transactions (timestamps, prices, volumes).
-   `market_news.csv`: Curated market news headlines and timestamps.
-   `tokenomics.json`: Metadata about token supplies, inflation rates, schedules.
-   `sentiment_analysis_labels.csv`: Pre-labeled sentiment data for news articles.

*These datasets represent the core information used to develop the Trademind AI's understanding of financial markets.*

## 🚀 How Trademind AI Was Trained Using This Data

-   **Sentiment Extraction**: Training data enabled Trademind AI to learn sentiment extraction from news and social media feeds.
-   **Trend Summarization**: Trademind AI was trained to summarize market activity using historical trading and news data.
-   **Feature Generation**: The datasets facilitated the training of Trademind AI to construct relevant ML features (e.g., volatility indicators) from structured and unstructured data.

## 🛠️ Setup (Exploring the Datasets)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/trademind/trademind-llm-datasets.git # Replace with actual URL
    cd trademind-llm-datasets
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies (for notebooks/utils):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Explore:**
    Dive into the `data/` directory or explore the `notebooks/` for examples of how this data can be processed and analyzed.

## 📌 Potential Future Directions

- Augmenting future Trademind AI versions with expanded real-world data integrations.
- Ongoing research into fine-tuning LLMs specifically on evolving trading language and market events.
- Exploring advanced predictive pipelines combining diverse data modalities.
- Facilitating research by the community using these datasets to understand AI in finance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These datasets are provided for educational, experimental, and research purposes, specifically to understand the type of data used to train the Trademind AI.
No real trading advice, financial recommendation, or live market data is provided or implied. The performance of the Trademind AI depends on many factors beyond these base datasets.
